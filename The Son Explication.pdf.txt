God’s Chosen Tiehteti-taibo
        A majority of action in the novel is centered around Eli (or Tiehteti), who is taken captive from his family estate on the edge of the frontier by Comanche raiders and forced to quickly adapt[a] to their foreign culture or face the prospect of losing his life.  Because of this, the selected passage holds massive importance to the rest of the narrative in that it marks both the moment when the tribe fully embraces Eli, and Eli fully embraces the tribe.  As we see throughout the book, an internal struggle exists within him as he takes a liking to the Comanche lifestyle, but is also hesitant to fully relinquish his white, Christian roots.  This constant balancing act is masterfully represented by the language of the passage, as Meyer uses both biblical concepts and terms to describe Eli’s sentiments during the scalping.  Meyer even goes as far as comparing the experience to being “dunked again,” a symbol of rebirth among Christian circles, and as we see in the following paragraphs, the perfect analogy for Eli’s metamorphosis from “pathetic little white boy” into a “proper Comanche.”
Although brave, clever, and blessed with the ability to quickly adapt (traits that are no doubt cherished among the Comanche), Eli’s journey from captive white boy to Comanche warrior is anything but easy.  He is subjected to a long, grueling process of near-death beatings, menial tasks, and a steep learning curve that [b]accompanies adjusting to an entirely new culture.  But in the end, these trials and tribulations are what makes this singular passage so gripping for readers and liberating for Eli himself, as his steady perseverance has finally paid off.  With his first scalp in the books, he has, at long last, proved his worth to the [c]other warriors while also earning their respect for the fearless fashion he did it in.  Upon their return to the village, everyone gathers to hear Pizon[d][e][f][g] recite the tale of the great Tiehteti who, with seemingly godsent luck and resolve, struck down the Delaware brave [h]in cold blood with only a weapon he could barely use.  In the last paragraph, it becomes evident that Eli has been accepted into the Comanche family, as he and his new tribesmen dance under the stars, united as one.  Even if only for a brief instant, not race or culture [i]or any detail in between could separate this mighty Empire of the Frontier, because at this[j][k] moment they were God’s “Chosen People,” free to rule over their domain as the great civilizations before them.
