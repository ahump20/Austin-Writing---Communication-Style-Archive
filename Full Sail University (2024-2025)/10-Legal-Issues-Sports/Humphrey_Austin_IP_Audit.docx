INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO BE PROTECTED

1. Blaze Sports Intel Brand Name and Logo

The "Blaze Sports Intel" name and logo are the primary identifiers of our sports analytics platform and represent significant business value in building market recognition, particularly in the college baseball analytics space where ESPN and other major platforms have underserved the market. Protection of these marks prevents competitors from creating confusion in the marketplace and establishes our brand equity as we expand coverage across neglected sports markets. We will protect these assets through federal trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) under Class 41 (education and entertainment services) and Class 9 (downloadable mobile applications), securing exclusive rights to use these marks in our market sector.

2. Proprietary Analytics Algorithms and Data Processing Methods

Our custom-built analytics algorithms that calculate advanced metrics for college baseball and other underserved sports represent core intellectual property that differentiates our platform from competitors. These algorithms process raw game data to generate unique statistical insights and predictive models that cannot be found on mainstream sports platforms, creating competitive advantage in markets ESPN has abandoned. We will protect these through a combination of trade secret protection (maintaining confidential development processes and restricting employee/contractor access through non-disclosure agreements) and potentially filing for patent protection if our methodologies prove sufficiently novel and non-obvious under patent law standards.

3. Mobile Application Source Code and User Interface Design

The source code underlying our mobile application, along with the specific user interface design and user experience flow, represents substantial development investment and creates our platform's distinctive look and functionality. Since our target users primarily consume sports content on mobile devices rather than desktop platforms, the mobile app is our primary product delivery mechanism and must be protected from replication. We will protect the source code through copyright registration with the U.S. Copyright Office and by maintaining it as a trade secret, while also pursuing design patent protection for unique interface elements that provide ornamental and functional innovations in sports content delivery.

4. Original Content, Analysis, and Data Visualizations

All original written content, statistical analysis, data visualizations, graphics, and video content created by our team represents copyrightable material that provides value to subscribers and differentiates our platform from competitors. This includes game recaps, player analysis, statistical breakdowns, and proprietary data visualizations that make complex analytics accessible to casual fans—content that should exist but doesn't on major platforms. We will protect this content through automatic copyright protection upon creation (which vests immediately under U.S. copyright law) and will include copyright notices on all published materials, while also registering our most significant works with the U.S. Copyright Office to establish a public record and enable statutory damages in infringement cases.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO BE LICENSED

Blaze Sports Intel will need to license official sports statistics and play-by-play data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and individual athletic conferences, particularly for college baseball but also for other NCAA-sanctioned sports we plan to cover. This data is essential for our analytics platform to function, as we cannot generate our proprietary metrics without access to the underlying raw game data, player statistics, and historical records that the NCAA and conferences control. To legally obtain this content, we will negotiate data licensing agreements directly with the NCAA and relevant conferences (such as the SEC, Big 12, and ACC), which will likely involve annual licensing fees based on usage volume and distribution scope. These agreements will specify the permitted uses of the data (including derivative analytics), any attribution requirements, restrictions on redistribution of raw data, and compliance with NCAA rules regarding amateurism and student-athlete privacy. We will also need to ensure our licenses allow for real-time data access during games to provide live statistics and updates to our users, which may require additional technical integration agreements and elevated licensing tiers. If direct licensing proves cost-prohibitive initially, we will explore partnerships with existing sports data providers like Sportradar or Stats Perform, who maintain wholesale licensing relationships with collegiate sports organizations and can sublicense data access to platforms like ours under master service agreements.
