Comanche Warfare in History and in the Novel
        During their reign over the Texas frontier from the early 1700s until the 1870s, the Comanche Indians ruled with an iron first, using guerilla tactics and unmatched riding skills to crush their foes despite oftentimes possessing inferior equipment to civilized society.  With a superb knowledge of the rugged land, Comanche warriors were famously brave, clever, and fearless in combat.  In addition, a knack for horseback combat coupled with otherworldly abilities using a bow were ingrained in all males from a young age, allowing warriors to initiate their raids in a calculated and precise manner that helped make up for a lack of relative numbers.  As a result, far fewer lives were sacrificed on average than the strategies conceived by white generals as the brutal, swift style of Comanche ambushes meant their unsuspecting victims were getting skinned by the time they even realized what was going on.
Surrounded by enemies in all directions, the Comanche empire spanned across North, Central, and West Texas; serving as a sizeable roadblock to expansion west of the Hill Country (see figure below).  Without the proper weaponry and a large, well-trained unit of men to fight alongside you, crossing into this territory meant certain death for those brave enough to test their luck.  This fact held up for any American, Mexican, Spaniard, Texan or non-Comanche Indian regardless of their creed, color, ethnicity or tribal ties; only making exception for those still young enough to assimilate to their culture of captives appropriately.  This fact is exampled from the very start of Philipp Meyer’s novel The Son, as we are thrown into the action with Eli’s family on the edge of the frontier who, like other families in this area, fall victim to an Indian attack.  Throughout the rest of the piece, as we shall see once Eli is finally accepted into the tribe, the way of the Comanche is not for the weak, and the enemies who oppose them do not typically die a peaceful death.

The Equine Effect: Superior Comanche Horsemanship
        Without the introduction of the horse to North America, it is likely that the Comanche empire on the frontier would have never came into being or, at the least, never reached the height it did.  As one source put it, “Comanche warriors would spend their lives on horseback; spurning to fight on foot; and adopting their tactics of warfare to fit.”[1]  Because of the prevalence of raiding as a tactic of waging war, the horse allowed a tribe to launch surprise attacks with ease.  Combined with impeccable marksmanship skills from horseback, warriors were capable of slicing through enemy combatants before the opponent was even aware of their presence.  In The Son, the perfect example of the emphasis placed on horsemanship and archery comes when Eli finally earns the right to begin training instead of performing women’s tasks.  As he puts it, Comanche children “could sit a horse that would have thrown any white man,” while at the same time having the skill to hit moving targets “with blunt arrows at a dead run” (p. 104).  This emphasis on honing such abilities from a young age meant white captives who were being assimilated tended to be far behind those who had grown up in the tribe from the start.  In addition, this also allowed boys to begin making a contribution to the collective by the time of their teen years, something of significance especially considered inferior Comanche numbers.
        Their unmatched horsemanship is also largely the reason the Comanche were capable of controlling such a massive territory of land on the frontier for nearly 200 years.  Not only did their abundance of horses allow travel across far distances, but also gave them an advantage when conducting raids. [2]  In some cases, Comanche warriors would even entirely avoid conflict if possible, attempting to steal horses without being detected in order to minimize losses.  Unsurprisingly, horses were the best way of measuring individual wealth among tribespeople, as well as serving as the most common item when bartering among each other and with native Texans alike.  Therefore, being adept at riding and raiding from a horseback position was vital in Comanche culture, not only holding importance in the rise of their great empire but also within it, typically determining one’s place in the social hierarchy of the village.
Setting the Stage: Comanche vs. White Conflict in Early Texas
        Comanche Indians and the white settlers that populated the Eastern portion of Texas never got along from the start as both vied for power over the vast area.  On one side, these Texans were encroaching on the land that had been under Comanche rule far before Stephen F. Austin and his original 300 were even conceived.  To the other side, consisting of a mix of both Americans and Texans alike, the Comanche stood as nothing more than a barrier to be broken down on the way to settled the West, and achieving the dream of Manifest Destiny.  In addition, Comanche frontier raids didn’t help solve the issue from the perspective of “civilized” Texans, further straining the already violent relationship as Comanches realized the wealth to be gained not only from looting, but also in taking captives for later sale back to their families or whoever else willing to pay a steep price (frustrating frontier families to no end).  Despite, the settlers were not entirely innocent, defying the trust of the Indian tribes on numerous occasions.
        In terms of historical examples, no incident better exemplifies the rocky and volatile relationship between the two cultures than the incident at the Council House Fight of 1840 in San Antonio.  Looking to hash out a peace treaty and give back hostages in exchange for recognition of the Comanchero’s (the Comanche’s homeland) borders, a group of Comanche delegates agreed to make their way into the city.  Upon arrival they were ambushed, leading to a massacre which ended in 35 dead Comanche (including women and children) along with 29 others either captured or imprisoned.[3]  Although those on the Texas side were injured as well, it was nearly entirely the result of friendly fire.  This rash course of action served to further widen the gap between the two warring groups, showing the Comanche that the white man could not be trusted.
In response, Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump began devising a counterattack to avenge his fallen brethren, herding together every single individual tribe he could muster in the area.  The result: an Indian attack like none other before it, one that would come to be known as the Great Raid of 1840.  With the first target as Victoria and the second Linville, it constitutes the largest Indian raid in terms of sheer numbers in the history of the United States.  Even more impressive was Buffalo Hump’s strategy of leading his troops, as he cut straight through the heart of Texas almost entirely undetected by using a seldom-used trail.  The entire time the Comanche raid took on a style of guerilla warfare, as the warriors swiftly cut down anyone in their way, pillaging the villages, and then burning what was left before moving on to the next town.  In the end, the entire city of Linville was destroyed in the process, an excess of 3,000 horses and mules were stolen, and white settlers had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in valuables.[4]  Unfortunately, on their return home after multiple days of looting Linville, the Indians were weighed down from the massive amount of prisoners, spoils, and steeds they had acquired.  Due to this, and how fast word of the attacks had spread, the Militia and the Rangers were able to “use hit and run tactics to press the savages hard from the rear,” and eventually, gather up a sufficient force to ambush the weakened Comanche collective in Plum Creek.[5]          Although a large chunk of the Comanche band was taken out, a significant number also fled the scene and survived as the opposing forces focused their efforts on regaining the stolen loot.  The crippling loss of life was evidence enough for Comanche leaders that they should never venture so far into enemy territory again (as no raids, especially of this scale, cut so deep into the heart of Texas again).  For the continuation of their reign over the western portion of the state, “horse warriors resumed their old hit and run guerilla tactics,” limiting their casualties (which, as mentioned earlier, was a pillar of Comanche tactics).[6]  On the other end, President Lamar decided to take the opposite course of action, sending a greater number of Rangers deeper than ever before into the Comancheria, giving little regard to how many men would be lost as long as the braves were “taught a lesson for their effrontery.”
Comanche vs. White Warfare in The Son
        In The Son Philipp Meyer never places any character in the midst of a battle as large in size as the Great Raid of 1840, which when considering the timeline of Eli’s story, makes perfect sense in terms of historical accuracy.  Instead, all Eli’s Indian action passages (and all other Comanche ones in the novel for that matter) have a quality of precise, well-calculated hit and run guerilla strategy.  That is not to say that Comanche warriors did not commonly fight in groups, as they did, they just tended to remain in smaller raiding parties where they’d be harder to detect.  A perfect example is represented early on when the homestead is attacked and Eli is taken captive.  First off, there is no prior indication that the assault is about to go down (or at least that Eli and his family is aware of) before it’s too late.  Second, the assault is quick as the Comanche warriors clearly more skilled in addition to significantly outnumbering the family.  Third, it occurs when Eli’s father is far from home, meaning everyone else in the house was either a child or women opposed to a well-trained gun.  Thanks to Toshaway’s insight later on, we see that all of the formerly mentioned variables were carefully planned for weeks in advance as the warriors scouted, and subsequently picked out, the frontier homestead with care.  Coupled with the Comanche tendency to minimize lives lost during fights at all costs, it becomes evident that Eli’s homestead perfectly fit the criteria for a speedy, low-risk raid.  Seeing as this passage in the book is one with a relatively small amount of Comanche bloodshed (only one killed), it embodies a near-perfectly executed example of their deliberate, swift raiding style when all goes to plan.  
        A large difference when comparing warfare (specifically weaponry) between white and Comanche culture is the emphasis on new technology that whites place.  While most plains Indians tended to use more or less similar equipment for most of their existence (bows, arrows, knives, etc.), we see a shift in the civilized world’s throughout the book, one that Comanches were not capable of matching up against with a simple bow.  This becomes clear when Eli is serving as colonel for the group of Indians under the Confederate States of America.  Although they are victorious in the raid against the Unionist forces, a Gatling gun is used against them, which is a weapon foreign even to Eli himself.  While the colonel doesn’t find the existence of the gun overly shocking, Flying Jacket and the rest of his tribe are utterly shocked that “a gun with which one man can kill forty,” even exists, much less was used against them in the field (p. 482).  Flying Jacket decides it’s in the best interest of his people to stop fighting while they can, and he bids Eli farewell.  At this point, as I’m sure many other tribes realized as well, all the skill on horseback and in archery in the world was futile.  It had become strikingly obvious that white society possessed both a superior number of people, all willing to die for some general they barely knew (who in turn, would not hesitate to squander their life for some cause he may not even support), and weaponry that gave an individual the ability to take out an entire tribe alone.
Comanche Expansion in the 18th and 19th Century
Before the Comanches ruled the plains of Texas, there were many other groups that had first called it home, but this began to change in a dramatic way beginning in the early 1700s.  In order to expel them from the area, the Comanche resorted to violence, using their superior horsemanship and raiding techniques to scare not only the Spanish out of the other area, but even other rival Indian groups that challenged them.  Prior to the Comanche rule, the Apaches were the dominant Indian group of the area, coexisting peacefully for the most part alongside the Spanish for years, trading with them as they were subjected to live in missions (which were an attempt to convert the tribe to Catholicism).[7]  In an effort to stop the swiftly expanding Comanche empire that was forcing the Lipan Apache further south into their territory, the Spanish made the decision to team up with the Apache tribes.  In addition, Comanche raiding along the border of modern-day Mexico and in Texas was also becoming an issue for the Spanish settlers, very few of which were willing to take a chance on living in an area with such a brutally violent tribe.  Another problem posed was the fact the Comanche themselves also “controlled most of the horses in the region and thus had more wealth and mobility” than the Spanish.  In effect, around 1750 the Comanche and their superior, yet decentralized army of skilled cavalry really began taking control of the region, either pushing out or capturing rival Indian tribe and Spanish citizens.  By this point, the Apache and Spanish both had been bullied out of the state of Texas, defeated and/or fully assimilated into Comanche culture.  Although this period of 1750 to the mid 1840s mainly consisted of warfare aimed at maintaining the area they felt belonged to them opposed to expansion, it still marked the height of Comanche reign.  During it, they held a steady control over the Comancheria, the domain the called home, living prosperously and happily until the outbreak of disease brought on by white settlement.  Nearly entirely decimated by the disease epidemic, the few number of warriors left standing still continued raiding on until around the 1870s, but eventually gave in and made a settlement with the United States government to settle on reservations.
Frontier Raids in Mexico and Texas
        In conjunction with horses, the lifeblood of Comanche society was built around raiding settlements on the border of the frontier, primarily on the border of Mexico and in Texas.  The reason for its importance is that it brought prosperity and wealth to the tribe, bolstering their number of horses and oftentimes reinforcing their depleted numbers with new captives to replace fallen members.  Furthermore, many settlers were willing to pay a large price for the return of loved ones and valuables that had been stolen from them because of Comanche military strength, reckoning it would be an easier course of action than waging war.  Not only were families living on the frontier enveloped in constant violence by these raids, the economies and growth of the entire area was stunted as it wasn’t entirely unusual for whole small villages to be wiped out by the total war tactics used.
        On the eve of the U.S.-Mexican War, Northern Mexico and its border towns especially felt the full force of the Comanche, having their economy crippled for years to come in the aftermath.[8]  Furthermore, political actors in the area had major issues figuring out a way to combat the ambushes while also holding off the United States army, becoming overwhelmed and lacking resources to do much.  Because of this, many officials turned against each other at just about every level of government, becoming corrupt in an attempt to secure as many resources as possible for their own wellbeing.  While this may not be the only reason that Mexico fell to the United States, attacks by Comanche and other Indian tribes certainly complicated the conflict for the country and, by the end of the fighting, Mexico had lost a good portion of land that they considered as part of their border.
        In the case of Texas, many settlers in the hill country and around the Mexican border were subject to Comanche attacks and theft more so than other spots in the state.  A majority of these attacks took the form of ambushes, often occurring at hours during the night when victims would be disoriented and not ready to fight.  From a Comanche perspective, this also helped in terms of preservation of life, as the enemy could be taken out before they had the chance to fight back.  This tactic is exampled well by the attack on Eli’s homestead, while the raid resulted in one casualty for the Comanche, they attacked in the dark of the night, catching the family off guard, swiftly finishing the fight as only Eli was able to get a shot off.  Cases such as these around the Fredericksburg area were not uncommon by any means, and the Germans who settled in this area had to always be prepared to fight.  In fact, even following the Civil War and the placement of a large portion of Comanche onto reservations, attacks just west of Fredericksburg and Gainesville were still so frequent that settlers abandoned it all together.  Therefore, looking at both the history of Mexico and Texas coupled with excerpts from The Son, we see that Comanche raiding affected the settler’s way of life profoundly over the course of nearly 200 years, shaping the frontier into the rough and unforgiving, yet beautiful land that still permeates in some aspects of its existence to this day.
Conclusion
        In both history and in The Son, it’s obvious that warfare played a central role in Comanche lifestyle as well as the rise and reign of the empire they created, as men were groomed for it from an extremely young age.  The introduction of the horse to North America was also crucial to the Comanche way of life, as it combined with their mastery of riding and shooting from horseback to make a style of waging war that was perfect for frontier life.  Having relatively small numbers, living to fight another day was valued above dying pridefully in defeat.  Warriors would never pick fights that weren’t calculated, oftentimes raiding homesteads or villages on the edge of the frontier that resulted in a low number of casualties  for the unit (if any at all).  Because of this, Comanches tended to prefer smaller groups in combat opposed to large, as they could travel faster and swiftly perform raids virtually undetected.  In conclusion, the Comanche style of warfare is one admired by many, marked by its unmatched archery and horseback skills that culminated into an empire that not only made the task of settling Texas daunting, but slowed the process of achieving the dream of Manifest Destiny for generations of Americans.
